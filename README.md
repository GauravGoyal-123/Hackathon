**Description of Idea**

**IDea** :We have  built a one-stop learning platform where students can help each other in solving coding problems. 
There is a discussion section where users can get to know about the variety of approaches to a single question. 
There is a profile page where all activities of users gets tracked.

**Problem** : For now, there is no such platform where user can directly upload their problems regarding programming and get the exact
solution with different approaches. To get the solution we need to go to different platforms but none provide us the chance to 
ask our query and most of the time we do not get the solution to the particular problem.
